          <p>
          I'm a professional problem solver with a passion for programming. I studied at Epicodus where I became proactive at working with multiple languages including JavaScript and C#. Through failure after failure, I've developed a tenacious focus to solve any problem that's placed in front of me. One look at my portfolio will reveal a student obsessed with learning and passionate about software development. 
          </p>
          <p>Iâ€™ve built 50+ projects with a variety of languages, tools and technologies, most times learning as I go, and always viewing challenges as opportunities. I recently finished my internship at HealthSaaS where I put my technical skills to the test as I worked on problems in every area of the codebase. From API design and relational databases to all things C# and Javascript, I greeted every challenge with a smile.
